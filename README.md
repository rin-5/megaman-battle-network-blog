# MegaMan Battle Network Blog
A small webpage made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript I made for a vocational school project. This installment of the project only contains the information about the MegaMan NT Warrior/Rockman.EXE anime.

## Getting Started

In order to view this page, you'll need to have the following things:
- Visual Studio Code installed on your computer.
- The Live Server extension installed.

If you have that, you can right-click the index-html and pick Open Live Server and voilà! You'll have a window in your default navigator running the webpage.
